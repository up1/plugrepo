      <description>This plugin is written for the Groovy on Grails web application framework, and intends to make it relatively easy to host media files such as images, Flash, movies and audio all on the Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (S3).  The goals of this plugin are as follows:

* Host and manage media assets on Amazon S3 for storage and performance advantages
* Provide easy mechanisms to reference S3-hosted assets in Grails applications
* Make most efficient and cost-effective use of S3 hosting resources

To achieve these goals, the plugin provides services to manage static media assets for a Grails application.  For the first revision of the plugin, the focus is on managing user uploaded static content.  Later revisions will place a focus on providing tools to migrate existing static content in a site (such as items under the /images folder) into S3.

This plugin uses the excellent JetS3t Toolkit (http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/) to communicate with the Amazon S3 service.

      <title>Build Test Data Plugin</title>
      <author>Ted Naleid and Joe Hoover</author>
      <authorEmail>contact@naleid.com</authorEmail>
      <description>\
Enables the easy creation of test data by automatic inspection of constraints.  Any properties that are required have
their constraints examined and a value is automatically provided for them.

It is intended to be used in integration tests to enable the test creator to specify the values that are under test, but
so that they can ignore the other values not under test and not need to worry about creating dummy data that is not
pertinent.

Unlike the Object Mother pattern or fixtures, it automatically adapts to changes in the domain plugin.  If new
constraints are added,

When creating properties, the plugin also can create an entire object graph if the constraints are expecting those values.

Here are a few examples:

class Person {
    String firstName
    String middleName
    String lastName

...  // TODO flesh out example

So if you have a Author and a Book:

class Author {
    String name

... // TODO flesh out example, might not be necessary in plugin description file, but more for blog post or web page

      <description>
	The plugin handles configurations of JA-SIG CAS client integration using 
	its Java client library versioned 2.1.1. Please note there is another Java
	client library which is heavily Spring based; Although it seems a natual 
	fit for Grails applications, it requires more configuration works to 
	kickstart.
	
	The client integration page of the library supported by this plugin is
	
	http://www.ja-sig.org/products/cas/client/javaclient/index.html
	
	Please make sure necessary configurations are made in your Grails 
	application's Config.groovy file.

	This plugin is based on the Circuit Breaker Pattern from Michael Nygard's book "Release It!" - 
	A circuit breaker allows one subsystem to fail without destroying the entire system. Once the danger has passed, the circuit breaker can be reset to restore full function to the system.

      <title>Provides JSON and XML Conversion for common Objects (Domain Classes, Lists, Maps, POJO)</title>
      <author>Siegfried Puchbauer</author>
      <authorEmail/>
      <description>
		The grails-converters plugin aims to give you the ability to convert your domain objects, maps and lists to JSON or XML very quickly, to ease development for AJAX based applications. The plugin leverages the the groovy "as" operator and extends the render method in grails controllers to directly send the result to the output stream. It also adds the Grails Codecs mechanism for XML and JSON.

      <description>		Based on DdlUtils from the Apache DB Project http://db.apache.org. 
		Keeps the schema in a generic xml file that can then be used to creates the db schema in any of the 
		supported databases. Data can also be extrernalized in files and then loaded via a grails script or at application startup.
		Load base/seed data into you database. Store/export the data in xml and this will load the database with your applications base records
		This can and is used for integration testing.
		This is also used for populating a databse with its neccesary records to do an initial install. 
		We use it to load tables like configuration params, ACL, acegi requestmaps etc..
		Works with Hsqldb,MsSql,MySql,Oracle,db2 and others that DdlUtils supports

      <description>Embedded dbs, like derby &amp; in-memory HSQL only allow access from within the JVM that is accessing the db. This presents a problem that you cannot run an external db admin tool to work with the db while your grails app is running. To get around this limitation I wrote small plugin (1 controller &amp; 3 gsps) that can be used to admin the db within the running grails' app. 
There are three actions with the following urls described below...

/$appname$/dbUtil/info - Shows info about the db (tables/columns/column type, etc)
/$appname$/dbUtil/data - Outputs all the actual data alphabetically by table
/$appname$/dbUtil/sql - Allows free-form select/update/delete commands

Note: I've included commons-dbutils-1.1 from apache in the lib directory.

IMPORTANT: You will definitely want to protect this controller's url from unauthorized access since the sql action can be used to do just about anything.

DbutilController.groovy
data.gsp
info.gsp
sql.gsp</description>

      <description>
Plugin installs an ehcache.xml file that has a distributed cache as well as a local cache that can be used by a service
and a tag lib.  Allows for each environment to have their ip address defined in config.  This allows boxes that have more than
one interface to define which interface should be used with ehcache.

Ubuntu users:
Modify your ${GRAILS_HOME}/bin/grails (exe on windows) to have the following:
export JAVA_OPTS=" $JAVA_OPTS -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=&lt;hostname&gt;"
Based on the ehcache FAQ &lt;http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/faq.html&gt; this only needs to be done on ubuntu machines

How to monitor the distributed caches ÔøΩ

Modify your ${GRAILS_HOME}/bin/grails (exe on windows) so that the JVM starts with the following params. Note you should only be doing the following in development.

export JAVA_OPTS=" $JAVA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9004"
export JAVA_OPTS=" $JAVA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false"
export JAVA_OPTS=" $JAVA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false"

Add the following to your BootStrap.groovy:

class BootStrap {

	def sessionFactory
    def init = {servletContext -&gt;
		CacheManager manager = new CacheManager()

		MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer()

		// Define ObjectName of the MBean
		ObjectName on = new ObjectName("Hibernate:type=statistics,application=ApplicationName");

		// Enable Hibernate JMX Statistics
		StatisticsService statsMBean = new StatisticsService();

		statsMBean.setSessionFactory(sessionFactory);
		statsMBean.setStatisticsEnabled(true);
		mbs.registerMBean(statsMBean, on);

		/**
		 * Enable Ehcache JMX Statistics
		 * Use CacheManager.getInstance() instead of new CacheManager()

		 * as net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.SingletonEhCacheProvider is used
		 * to ensure reference to the same CacheManager instance as used
		 * by Hibernate
		 */
		ManagementService.registerMBeans(manager, mbs, true, true, true, true);

	}
	def destroy = {
	}
}

Now start up the application and use jconsole to connect to your local system.

      <description>The drilldowns plugin allows a user to drill down from a summary level screen to
a more detailed level. For example, from a list of authors to a list of books by
the selected author. It works by controller and action - usually the 'list'

drilldown stack, whether as the 'drill from' list or the 'drill to' list. Any
list page can be both a 'drill from' and a 'drill to' page thus allowing the
creation of the 'stack' of drilldowns.

      <title>This plugin extends Grails' data binding possibilities, both for parsing the user input and to present formatted data</title>
      <author>Luis Fernando Planella Gonzalez</author>
      <authorEmail>lfpg.dev@gmail.com</authorEmail>
      <description>The extended data binding plugin aims to allow configuring the DataBinder which controllers will use to parse
the user input and populate objects, as well as using a custom class, WrappedBean to format data as String.
This configuration can be done application-wide by setting closures on the servlet context 
(possibly on the ApplicationBootStrap) on the following attributes: newDataBinder (takes the request and the 
object and should return a GrailsDataBinder instance) and newBeanWrapper (also takes the request and the 
object and should return a Spring's BeanWrapper instance).
This plugin adds some methods to controllers: getBinder (takes an object and returns a DataBinder for that object, setting
it on the request under the attribute 'dataBinder'), wrapBean (takes an object and returns a WrappedBean instance - 
a class that uses an Spring's BeanWrapper and converts properties to strings using registered PropertyEditors) and bind 
(takes an object, performs the data binding and returns the object itself). Both getBinder and wrapBean methods invoke 
the global newDataBinder or newBeanWrapper closures (as explained above) and try calling a registerCustomEditors method 
(passing the object) on the controller, which may be used to set any specific PropertyEditors on either DataBinder or 
BeanWrapper). The getBinder also tries caling a initBinder method on the controller after registerCustomEditors. 
Also, a tag library adds the following tags to the 'g' namespace: wrap (takes a bean attribute and a var attribute,
exporting a WrappedBean instance into the given var - optionally under a custom scope) and eachWrapped (same as g:each,
but automatically wrapping each element)

      <description>
		This plugin adds a feedType and feedVersion parameters to the render method of controllers, which if passed
		a valid feed type such as "rss" or "atom" and a version will expect a closure to be passed with render,
		which will render a feed using a custom builder. The FeedBuilder used for this accepts entry and content nodes, any properties
		of which can be set within the builder. These are beans from the ROME API so all properties there
		should work.

      <description>
		This plugin adds a feedType and feedVersion parameters to the render method of controllers, which if passed
		a valid feed type such as "rss" or "atom" and a version will expect a closure to be passed with render,
		which will render a feed using a custom builder. The FeedBuilder used for this accepts entry and content nodes, any properties
		of which can be set within the builder. These are beans from the ROME API so all properties there
		should work.

      <author>Rainer Brang, Backend-Server GmbH &amp; Co. KG</author>
      <authorEmail>grails@backend-server.de</authorEmail>
      <description>This plugin adds i18n support to your app, in 'gnu gettext'-style.
1 First, you need to wrap special method calls around all strings you want to translate.
2 Then you use an included Gant script to extract all translatable strings from your sources.
3 Now you translate all strings from step 2 which you will find in .po files in your i18n directory.
4 Use another included Gant script to compile your translated .po files into resource classes.
5 repeat 1-4 each time you added some new strings to your application. Existing translations will be merged in. 

During runtime: The methods, you wrapped around the strings, will pick the correct translation according to the
current locale, and return the translated string. You may also force a locale for a specific call.

What you need: The developer needs these command line tools for the development machine: xgettext, msgmerge and msgfmt
The translator may like: PoEdit or alike to translate texts.

You will love the dead simple plural form handling and FormatMessage-like String handling. Additionally, you can 
forget about inventing lookup keys for your .properties files, because for gnu gettext, the original string is the key.

Beware: Gnu gettext can not handle groovy's "here-doc" strings.

      <description>This plugin adds i18n support to your app, in 'gnu gettext'-style.
1 First, you need to wrap special method calls around all strings you want to translate.
2 Then you call "grails i18ngettext" to extract all translatable strings from your sources.
3 Now you translate all strings from step 2 which you will find in .po files in your i18n directory.
4 Call "grails i18ngettext makemo" to compile your translated .po files into resource classes.
5 repeat 1-4 each time you added some new strings to your application. Existing translations will be merged in. 

During runtime: The methods, you wrapped around the strings, will pick the correct translation according to the
current locale, and return the translated string. You may also force a locale for a specific call.

What you need: The developer needs these command line tools for the development machine: xgettext, msgmerge and msgfmt
The translator may like: PoEdit or alike to translate texts.

You will love the dead simple plural form handling and FormatMessage-like String handling. Additionally, you can 
forget about inventing lookup keys for your .properties files, because for gnu gettext, the original string is the key.
Plus: No more problems with special chars like german umlauts. gettext can handle that.

Beware: 
a) Gnu gettext can not handle groovy's "here-doc" strings.
b) Your original strings should be english, because Gnu gettext can't cope with non-ascii characters as original strings.

      <description>\
This plugin will basically add the required libraries for IBM i support. (JTOpen)
Use this to utilize IBM i as a database server, or to access
business logic available on the IBM i platform.
The supplied script 'install-ibmi-datasource' will configure a new
DataSource.groovy with support for IBM i as a database server.
The existing datasource will be backed up as DataSource.groovy.bak
The plugin provides user types for domain classes to support commonly used
legacy columns from IBM i:
- Date stored as DEC(9 0) format YYYYMMDD. Use type: 'com.multisupport.util.grails.DecimalDate'
- Boolean stored as CHAR(1) 0/1. Use type: 'com.multisupport.util.grails.OneZeroBoolean'
- Boolean stored as CHAR(1) Y/N. Use type: 'com.multisupport.util.grails.YesNoBoolean'

      <description>		Jawr is a tunable packaging solution for Javascript and CSS which allows for rapid development of resources 
		in separate module files. You can work with a large set of split javascript files in development mode, then
		Jawr bundles all together into one or several files in any way you define. By using a tag library, Jawr allows 
		you to use the same, unchanged GSP pages for development and production. Jawr also minifies and compresses the 
		files, resulting in reduced page load times.

      <title>JSR 311 plugin for Grails</title>

      <description>
A plugin that supports the development of RESTful web services based on the 
Java API for RESTful Web Services (JSR 311: JAX-RS). It is targeted at 
developers who want to structure the web service layer of an application in 
a JSR 311 compatible way but still want to continue to use Grails' powerful 
features such as GORM, automated XML and JSON marshalling or Grails filters, 
to mention a few. This plugin is an alternative to Grails' built-in mechanism 
for implementing RESTful web services and is backed up by Jersey, the JSR 311 
reference implementation.

      <title>Localizations (messages) plugin</title>
      <author>Paul Fernley</author>
      <authorEmail>paul@pfernley.orangehome.co.uk</authorEmail>
      <description>The localizations plugin alters Grails to use the database as its means of
internationalization rather than message bundles (property files) in the i18n
directory of your application. All property files in the i18n directory of your
application (but not subdirectories of i18n) are automatically loaded in to the
database the first time a message is requested after the plugin is installed.
There is also an import facility (at a URL similar to
http://myServer/myApp/localizations/imports) to load subsequently created
property files - often the result of later installation of plugins. A 'message'
method is added to all domain classes and service classes as a convenience. An
'errorMessage' method is added to all domain classes that can set an error
message on either the domain as a whole or on a particular property of the
domain. A localizations controller and CRUD screens are included with the plugin.
The screens assume you are using a layout called main. Your database must be
configured to allow the use of Unicode data for this plugin to work.

      <description>
    Postcode plugin provides the PostCodeService which you can use to calculate the lat/lon coordinates
    of UK postcodes using the free database embedded within it (from nearby.org.uk). The service also has
    a function for calculating the distance between two postcode centres. Over 10,000 postcode centres are
    supplied, but this is for postcode sectors not street-level information. The distances are calculated using
    the Haversine formula.

      <title>Restore State Plugin</title>
      <author>Marcel Overdijk</author>
      <authorEmail>marceloverdijk@gmail.com</authorEmail>
      <description>This plugin provides convenient methods to controller classes for remembering state.
With the default Grails scaffolding each time you navigate away from a list page (e.g. going to the show page) the state of the list is lost when you return. 
This can be annoying when you paged to a certain page within the list.
A typical use case for this plugin is restoring the pagination state (like offset and sorting) of list pages.

This plugin allows a developer to assemble screens from meta-data that is stored in the database.
Essentially it is a modular templating system for GSPs. It can potentially allow an application's users
to configure the applications screens at runtime. The best way to understand how the plugin actually
works is by running the demo included with the plugin and perusing the demo code. You can access the
demo after installing the plugin into your application by going to the following url?
http://server:port/YourApp/screenWizDemo/list

      <title>Spring Caching Plugin</title>
      <author>Rob Fletcher</author>
      <authorEmail>rob@energizedwork.com</authorEmail>
      <description>Allows caching pointcuts to be easily applied to Spring managed beans in a Grails application (e.g. services). Default
cache configuration uses EHCache but this can easily be overridden by declaring 'cacheManager' and 'cacheProviderFacade'
beans in resources.groovy. See https://springmodules.dev.java.net/docs/reference/0.9/html/cache.html for more details on
how to configure alternate caching providers.

      <title>Spring Cache Plugin</title>
      <author>Rob Fletcher</author>
      <authorEmail>rob@energizedwork.com</authorEmail>
      <description>Uses the spring-modules-cache library to allow caching pointcuts to be easily applied to Spring managed beans in a
Grails application (e.g. services). Default cache configuration uses a simple ConcurrentHashMap backed cache
implementation but this can easily be overridden by declaring 'cacheManager' and 'cacheProviderFacade' beans in
conf/resources.groovy.

Simply add @Cacheable(modelId="myCachingModel1") to methods that should cache their results and
@CacheFlush(modelId="myFlushingModel") to methods that should flush the cache. The modelId attribute should match models
configured in Config.groovy, e.g.:
    springcache {
        cachingModels {
            myCachingModel1 = 'cacheName=CACHE_1'
            myCachingModel2 = 'cacheName=CACHE_2'
        }
        flushingModels {
            myFlushingModel = 'cacheNames=CACHE_1,CACHE_2'
        }
    }
For more on specific options for configuring caching and flushing models see:
https://springmodules.dev.java.net/docs/reference/0.9/html/cache.html#cachingModels and
https://springmodules.dev.java.net/docs/reference/0.9/html/cache.html#flushingModels

Be aware that the annotations will only have any effect on Spring-managed beans. If you create instances of your class
directly rather than getting them from the application context they will not be decorated with caching/flushing
behaviour.

See https://springmodules.dev.java.net/docs/reference/0.9/html/cache.html for more details on how to configure alternate
caching providers.

Caching can be disabled with the config key springcache.disabled=true, for exaple you may want to do this in your test
environment to avoid having methods you are testing returning cached results.

		* New in 0.2: The EndpointFunctionalTestCase has been updated to package a more
		  groovy withEndpointRequest closure that significantly tightens up your endpoint
		  functional test code. (Thanks to Graeme Rocher for the input there!)
        * On the service provision side, a first-class endpoint	artefact is introduced including

      <description>The Stark Security plugin -- 'stark' as in simple, but also 'strong' in Swedish -- is an implementation of
Spring Security for Grails.  It employs a lock-down approach to security, meaning all access is
disallowed by default.  Developers open access for roles on a controller-method basis, and non-controller
URLs (e.g. /js/**) can be configured separately.  All mappings are read by convention,
there is no configuration beyond hooking up the desired authentication implementations.

      <description>The Stark Security plugin -- 'stark' as in simple, but also 'strong' in Swedish -- is an implementation of
Spring Security for Grails.  It employs a lock-down approach to security, meaning all access is
disallowed by default.  Developers open access for roles on a controller-method basis, and non-controller
URLs (e.g. /js/**) can be configured separately.  All mappings are read by convention,
there is no configuration beyond hooking up the desired authentication implementations.

      <description>
        A plugin for creating a Vaadin application on Grails. This plugin will
    automatically enable an application to specify a Vaadin Application class
    from which the application will start.
        After installing the plugin:
    1) Create a class that extends com.vaadin.Application
    2) Specify this class in the Vaadin configuration file
        (grails-app/conf/VaadinConfig.groovy)
    3) Remove the URL mappings for the URL where you want to access the
        Vaadin application.
    3) Execute grails run-app

      <title>Webdav plugin for grails</title>

      <description>\
This plugin provides a WEBDAV interface for grails. It's core functionalitiy is to
 provide support for exposing your domain model to a webdav interface.

For the underlying webdav stuff, the webdav-servlet project (http://webdav-servlet.sourceforge.net/index.html)
is used. Thanks to those folks for providing a open source webdav servlet implementation.
So the plugin code itself is nothing more than a small integration layer.

To use webdav in your app you need to take the following steps:

1) add a webdav definition part to your Config.groovy

Example 1:
    grails.webdav =  [
        webdav: [
                url: '/webdav/*',
        ]
    ]
    A webdav share with the internal name 'webdav' is accessible under http://localhost:8080/&lt;app&gt;/webdav

Example 2:

    grails.webdav =  [
        webdav1: [ url: '/webdav_folder1/*' ],
        webdav2: [ url: '/webdav_folder2/*' ],
        webdav3: [
            url: '/filesystemview/*,
            init: [
                rootpath: System.properties.'java.io.tmpdir',
                storeDebug: 1,
                'no-content-length-headers': 0,
                lazyFolderCreationOnPut: 0
            ]

    ]

    Provides three webdav shares: webdav1 maps to http://localhost:8080/&lt;app&gt;/webdav_folder1
     and webdav2 maps to http://localhost:8080/&lt;app&gt;/webdav_folder2. The third one provides
     some servlet init parameters.

If you're fine with a single webdav folder mapping
    webdav -&gt; http://localhost:8080/&lt;app&gt;/webdav
you don't have to do anything in Config.groovy - this is the plugin's default
behaviour by convention.

2) implement a service class implementing WebdavMapper for each entry in your webdav configuration
This class defines the contents of your webdav shares.

There's a special naming convention for these service classes:
 WebdavMapper_&lt;internalname&gt;Service.groovy

So for the above example 1 you have to implement WebdavMappper_webdavService,
for example 2 you need WebdavMapper_webdav1Service and WebdavMapper_webdav2Service.
These service should be in the root package (aka no package declaration)

If the plugin does not find your service class for a specific webdav share, it falls
 back and uses the net.sf.webdav.LocalFileSystemStore to expose a local directory to webdav.

3) prevent Grails UrlMapping acting on Webdav-URLs: add an exlcude setting in your UrlMappings.groovy
Example:
     class UrlMappings {
    static mappings = {
      "/$controller/$action?/$id?"{
	      constraints {
			 // apply constraints here
		  }
	  }
	  "500"(view:'/error')
      static excludes = ["/webdav_folder1/*"]  // repeat this one for each of your webdav shares
	}

      <title>Grails XMPP Plugin</title>
      <author>F√°bio Franco Uechi</author>
      <authorEmail>fabio.uechi@gmail.com</authorEmail>
      <description>\
Provides XMPP/Jabber based services to grails applications. Built upon the Smack API this plugin allows
an application to send and receive xmpp packets (presence, message, etc). Basically it creates a Roster 
which automatically connects, to a pre configured host, at application startup. All the mentioned xmpp 
services rely upon this Roster. Eases the development of real-time web applications.
One of the main features is the ability to expose methods as commands (method name = command) making it 
easier to develop XmppBots, for example.
Another feature is auto-detection of PacketListeners and RosterListeners.

      <description>This plugin provides extensible template capabilities for static scaffolding.
The default scaffolding templates are limited to generate list, create, edit and show views. With the Xtemplates plugin you can generate any number of views.
In the Xtemplates generation process also a runtime loaded Helper class (which can be customized just like the templates) is binded so you can execute any code in the generation process.
